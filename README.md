# redux-practice

Practice app to understand flow of data in a React/Redux app.

### This is intended to be used as a reference app. As such, the codebase will include:

* Copious (over-abundant & **very** verbose) explanatory comments that detail the purpose of (e.g.) a line or block of code.
* Dead/commented out code that has been re-factored
